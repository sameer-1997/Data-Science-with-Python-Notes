Data Science with Python --- Day1
===================================


Agenda
-------
Course Introduction
Batch Introduction
What is Data Science
Roles in a Data Scientist Project
Set of Practices / Actions a Data Scientist Does?


What is Data Science?

- Extracting Intelligence
- Generating Business
- Gathering Data from various sources


Data Science is a set of CROSS-DISCIPLINARY PRACTICES:

- Data Engineering (Dealing with RAW data)
	- Performing Data Acquisition and making data in one format
	Hadoop, Spark

- Descriptive Statistics
- Data Mining / Machine Learing
- Deep Learning
- Predictive Analytics

to generate DATA PRODUCT / BUSINESS DECISIONS !!!


What is Bigdata?

Bigdata is a TERM. Its not a technology. Its not a TOOL. Its all about the ability of the software/framework/architecture to HANDLE the data.

HANDLE refers to :
	1. LOAD
	2. PROCESS
	3. STORE

If any of the above fails, you are facing a BIGDATA PROBLEM. Thus BIGDATA is problem definition !!!!

e.g. 201201hourly.txt --- 507MB

Notepad --> It tried but FAILED to LOAD the data. THUS for notepad, its a BIGDATA !!!
Wordpad --> It tried, had some LATENCY, but loaded the data successfully. THUS for wordpad, its a NORMAL DATA !!!


Typical Project Roles in Data Science
=======================================

1. Client  --- Represent the END user who will pay for using our data product | Giving them decisions.
		Rs.100

2. Project Sponsers -- Represent the business interest, Budget Handling, Timeline chart, Reports etc	
		Rs.10

3. Data Scientist -- Set and Execute Analytic Strategy, Communicate with the Sponser and Client
		
		- GOD of Data
		- Expert in Statistics
		- Expert in Maths
		- Sound Technical Knowledge of all Tools which is associated to data
		- Awesome in Domain Knowledge
		- Expert in Story Telling

Learn how to speak their language --- Comfortable with Jargon

STONE   HARD
	COLD
	ROCK
	WATER
	SOUL STONE
	MILE STONE
	GREY
	ICE
	DIAMOND


Civil Engineer ---> Concrete Stone, Bricks
Doctor -----------> Gall Blader , Kidney Stone
Archeaologist ----> Fossil Rocks
Gemologist -------> Emerald , Ruby, Topaz, 



Setup my team  (Expedite the team)
======================================
1. Domain Expert
2. Expert in Python Language
3. PMP guy (manage my project ) 
4. Expert in Data Engineering
5. Deployment and Handover.

4. Data Architect --- Manage the data and ensures all process are uptime!
	
	- Expert in Hadoop , Spark , Distributed DB
	- Expert in Data Handling
	- Expert in NoSQL

5. Operations ---> Manages the Infra, Deploys Final Project
		Keeps the project 












4. Data Architect

5. Operations Team (Web Dev, DB team)







Set of Practices / Actions a Data Scientist Does?

1. Understand the Problem Statement and figure out whether you are comfortable with the domain or not?
2. Relate the problem statement with Domain and perform cross-domain reference.
3. Gather Relevant data / data product for the use-case.
4. Apply Statistical Analysis over the data to the understand the data.
5. Applying ML/DL algo over data
6. Visualizing the results
7. Presenting the result infront of the STAKEHOLDER using The STAKEHOLDER's JARGON
8. Providing further inputs /strategies that can enhance their business
9. Keeping a watch on KPI metrics to understand whether the product is performing or not
